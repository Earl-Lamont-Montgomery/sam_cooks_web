A dashboar showing COVID-19 Vaccination doses administered in the United States. The lower bar chart is the daily number of doses administered in the state selected by the dropdown. The map shows the number of daily doses administered in every state as of the latest data. By brushing the bottom barchart you can select the date for the map to visualize, with the circles representing the number of doses administered in each state on the date at the end of the selected date range.

This barchart has been revised to have non-overlapping circles and to resolve a glitch where circles were appended rather than updated
